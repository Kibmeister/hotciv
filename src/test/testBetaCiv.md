Test list for HotCiv Beta
===================
[] Refactor AlphaCiv to use compositional design 
    [] This implies creating a Winner strategy and a world aging strategy 
    [] Create an interface winner strategy, responsible for selecting the winner of the game 
    [] Create an interface age strategy, responsible for controlling the aging of the world 
    [] By doing so, we acheive a compositional design by delegating the responsibility to two interfaces
